narrator: [i]Lam-Ang treads deeper into unfamiliar land, the forest thick and ancient. A sudden rustle—then silence[i]

narrator: [i]From the shadows, a figure emerges. An Igorot warrior, adorned in beads and scars, steps forward, holding a heavy axe.[/i]

igorot: You do not belong here, stranger.

lam-ang: I seek no trouble. I walk only where the winds lead me.

igorot: Then the wind has betrayed you. This is sacred ground… and you trample it like it’s yours.

narrator: [i]Lam-Ang straightens, hand drifting toward his weapon, his voice firm but calm.[/i]

lam-ang: I walk with respect. But I will not back down.

narrator: [i]The warrior narrows his eyes, stepping closer, the tension between them thick as fog.[/i]

igorot: Respect is earned. If your feet won’t leave… then your strength must speak.

narrator: [i]He points his axe toward Lam-Ang, his voice rising like thunder through the trees.[/i]

igorot: Enough talk. Show me your worth!

narrator: [i]The two lock eyes, warriors bound by honor and fire, on the edge of battle.[/i]

igorot: Draw your weapon… and let the land witness our clash!
