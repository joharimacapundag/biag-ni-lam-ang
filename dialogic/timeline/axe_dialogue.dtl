[i]Lam-Ang spots an old axe leaning against a tree stump, its blade weathered but still sharp.[/i]

lam-ang: This… this is more than just a tool. It’s the [color=red]"wasay"[/color].

lam-ang: [color=red]"Wasay"[/color]—the Ilocano word for axe. I remember Mother whispering it when I helped gather firewood as a boy.

lam-ang: Back then, it was for warmth and food. Now, it may be for something else entirely.

[i]He grips the handle firmly, feeling its weight in his hand. The memories of home echo faintly with each grain of the wood.[/i]

lam-ang: Whether clearing paths or defending myself, this [color=red]"wasay"[/color] will remind me of where I began.

[i]Lam-Ang secures the axe to his belt and moves forward, the quiet strength of his roots steadying his step.[/i]
