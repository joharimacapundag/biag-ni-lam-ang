He pushed open the heavy gate with a loud creak. Inside, dozens of Igorot warriors turned to face him, weapons drawn, their eyes burning with anger[color=red](rurod)[/color].

Their leader, a massive man with scars across his face, stepped forward.

I am Lam-Ang, son of Don Juan! You killed my father [color=red](ama)[/color], and today you will answer!

The warriors jeered and closed in, their weapons glinting under the sun.
igorot: A boy dares challenge us? STOP! (AGSARDENG KA!) Turn back while you still breathe!
lam-ang: No. I will not retreat. War [color=red](Gubat)[/color] is upon you!
