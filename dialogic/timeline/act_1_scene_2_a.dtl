rooster: Tulungan! Tulungan!  dak! A hunter… he’s after me!
Lam-Ang frowns, trying to recall the few Ilocano words his mother taught him.
lam-ang: [i]‘Tulungan’ means ‘help,’ doesn’t it? But... a hunter? What does that mean?[/i]
Before Lam-Ang can ask further, a gruff voice interrupts from behind a clump of bushes. A HUNTER steps forward, eyes fixed on the rooster.

hunter: Hey! Easy there, little bird. I’m not out here for mischief I’m hunting for food. I need a rooster to feed my family.
narrator: The rooster flutters higher, its eyes wide with terror. Lam-Ang steps between the hunter and the bird.
lam-ang: Wait a moment—this little one is clearly frightened. I don’t think he’s meant for your dinner tonight.”
narrator: The hunter narrows his eyes, slightly taken aback by Lam-Ang’s interference.
hunter: Listen, kid, I understand your concern. But I’m only doing what I must to survive. This rooster is my meal, not a plaything.
lam-ang: I respect that you need to hunt for food, but isn’t there another way? Look at his eyes—he’s terrified. I can help him, and maybe we can find a better solution.
lam-ang: [i]How I convince this guy?[/i]
rooster: Help me... please, help me...
lam-ang: [i]Okay, maybe Ilocano words might convince him[/i]
