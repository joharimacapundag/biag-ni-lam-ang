[i]Lam-Ang sees a long weapon resting against a weathered stone, partly hidden by vines. Its point gleams, untouched by time.[/i]

[i]He approaches and grips it, the shaft cold and steady in his hand.[/i]

lam-ang: The [color=red]"gayang"[/color]… a spear.

lam-ang: I remember now. [color=red]"Gayang"[/color], the Ilocano word. My uncle once said it pierces not just beasts… but fear itself.

[i]He lifts it with purpose. The weight is just right, as if it waited only for him.[/i]

lam-ang: This [color=red]"gayang"[/color] is a reminder. A hunter’s resolve… and a warrior’s promise.

[i]He gazes into the distance, clutching the weapon as the wind stirs leaves at his feet.[/i]

lam-ang: I carry it not to destroy… but to protect what matters most.
