[i]Inside the belly of the beast, Lam-Ang finds darkness and despair.
Yet even here, he does not surrender.
He draws his dagger, determined to fight even to his last breath.[/i]

Lam-Ang (resolute):
 I will not give up!

[i]He stabs the heart of the monster from within.
Berkakan thrashes and roars, and at last — with a thunderous collapse — dies upon the river.[/i]
