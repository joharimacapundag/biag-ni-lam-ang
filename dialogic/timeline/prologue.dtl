The stage is set in a humble village. Villagers are busy with daily chores when suddenly shouts and clashing sounds erupt. A group of Igorot warriors burst in, seizing food and supplies, and creating pandemonium.
villagers: Look out! The Igorots have come grab what you can and hide!
Amid the chaos, DON JUAN strides forward, his face resolute as he rallies the villagers.
\don_juan: We cannot let these invaders strip us of our life! I will take the fight to the mountains and drive them away!
villagers: But Don Juan, what if you don’t return? Our future lies with you!
\don_juan: My people, my heart, I must do what is necessary—even if it means risking my life. Trust in the courage that lives in us all.
As the Igorots continue their rampage, DON JUAN disappears into the mountain mists, leaving the villagers with heavy hearts and uncertain futures.
