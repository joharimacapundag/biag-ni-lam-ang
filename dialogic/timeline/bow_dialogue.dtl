[i]Lam-Ang kneels by a tree stump, inspecting a finely crafted bow resting before him. The curve is strong, the string tightly woven.[/i]

lam-ang: A bow… light and silent, yet deadly when aimed with purpose.

lam-ang: Father once told me, *"A warrior's true strength isn't only in the blade but in his ability to strike from afar."*

lam-ang: He called it [color=red]"pana"[/color] the Ilocano word for bow.

lam-ang: [color=red]"Pana"[/color]. I’ll remember that. Every weapon has a soul when it serves a just cause.

[i]Lam-Ang gently lifts the pana and tests its pull. It feels balanced, as if waiting for his hand all along.[/i]

lam-ang: This will serve me well—not to hunt glory, but to protect those who still believe in justice.

[i]With a deep breath, he slings the pana across his back and looks toward the path ahead, more resolved than ever.[/i]
