The village lies in ruin—burnt huts, scattered belongings. Smoke lingers. Lam-ang arrives, eyes sharp, jaw tight.

villagers: Lam-ang! You're back—but too late… They came at dawn like ghosts—those Igorot raiders!

lam-ang: How many?

villagers: Too many to count… They swept in from the trees, took rice, chickens—even young men. No mercy.

lam-ang: I should have been here. I should have buried my father's bones in peace.

elder_villager: Lam-ang, the Igorots dwell far north—deep in the Cordilleras, where the air is thin and the stones bleed history. Your anger is strong, but so are they.

lam-ang: [grits his teeth] They butchered my father. He went to negotiate, not to die. And now you tell me they vanished into their mountains again, as if nothing ever happened?

villagers: A merchant claims he saw him—Don Juan—dragged in chains through the mists of Sagada.

lam-ang: Then I will carve his name into their stone walls with their blood.

elder_villager: Lam-ang, listen! You carry the blood of warriors, yes—but wisdom too. The Igorots are not mindless beasts. They fight for their land, as you fight for your father.

lam-ang: I do not seek understanding. Only justice. Only retribution.

villagers: Then beware the mountain winds… They twist men’s hearts. You chase ghosts into clouds—and may lose yourself in the fog.

lam-ang: Then let the fog swallow me. I will not rest until their screams echo like ours.

Lam-ang turns to the mountains. The villagers watch him go, unsure if he’ll return the same.
