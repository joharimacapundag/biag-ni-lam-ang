[i]Lam-Ang kneels beside a half-buried object in the soil. He brushes the dirt away to reveal a round wooden shield, worn yet sturdy.[/i]

lam-ang: A [color=red]"Sarapa"[/color]... just like the ones the elders described in stories.

lam-ang: [color=red]"Sarapa"[/color] is the Ilocano word for shield. I remember now— Father used that word when teaching me how to block, not just attack.

lam-ang: A shield doesn’t just protect the body it guards the values we carry, the people we love.

[i]He straps the [color=red]"salungso"[/color] onto his arm, the weight a reminder of duty and legacy.[/i]

lam-ang: I will carry this not just for battle, but for what it means to defend what matters most.
