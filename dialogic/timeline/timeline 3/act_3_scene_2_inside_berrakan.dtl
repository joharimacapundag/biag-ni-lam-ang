[i]Inside the belly of the beast, Lam-Ang finds darkness and despair.
Yet even here, he does not surrender.
He draws his dagger, determined to fight even to his last breath.[/i]

Lam-Ang (resolute):
I will not give up!

[i]He stabs the heart of the monster from within.
Berkakan thrashes and roars, and at last — with a thunderous collapse — dies upon the river.[/i]

[i]On the riverbanks, the rooster and dog cry out for their master.
The villagers arrive, mourning the brave young man who gave his life for them.[/i]

Villager (weeping):
Lam-Ang... you are gone, but your [color=red]"biag"[/color] (life) lives on in our hearts.

[i]Ines Kannoyan, learning of his fate, weeps by the river for many days.
But Lam-Ang’s spirit lives on —
in every rooster’s crow,
in every river’s song,
in every heart that dreams of courage and sacrifice.[/i]
