[i]Lam-Ang steps into a shadowed clearing, the light catching a dagger stuck in the ground, its edge gleaming softly.[/i]

[i]He kneels, his voice low with memories of his father’s quiet strength.[/i]

lam-ang: The [color=red]"panagdi"[/color]... a warrior's dagger.

lam-ang: "Panagdi" Ilocano for dagger. A symbol of stealth, and fate’s hand.

[i]His fingers brush the hilt, the blade light in his grip yet heavy with meaning.[/i]

lam-ang: This [color=red]"panagdi"[/color] is more than just a weapon. It's a tool of vengeance... and a quiet death.

[i]The wind stirs, whispering the weight of the choice he’s about to make.[/i]

lam-ang: I will not strike for revenge, but for justice. For those who need it most.
